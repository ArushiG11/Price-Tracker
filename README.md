# Next.js Practice Application

This project is a practice application built with Next.js, created while following a tutorial by JS Mastery. It serves as an educational project to learn and explore Next.js features, including routing, server-side rendering, API integration, and dynamic routing.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing:** Navigate through product details using dynamic routes.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Fetch product data server-side for efficient, SEO-friendly pages.

- **Reusable Components:** Modular components like `PriceInfoCard` and `ProductCard` are designed for easy reuse and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for production-ready applications
- **TypeScript** - Static typing to improve development reliability
- **MongoDB** - Database for storing product data and user information
- **CSS Modules/Tailwind CSS** - Customizable styling options

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate into the directory.
2. Install dependencies with:
3. Set up a MongoDB database and add your MongoDB connection URI in .env.local.
4. Run npm run dev to start the development server.

## Usage
Browse through a catalog of products, view detailed information, and see similar product suggestions. Use this app as a template or learning reference for future Next.js projects.
